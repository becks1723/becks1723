Hi, I’m @becks1723, an aspiring web designer and software programmer from New York City.
I’m interested in creating websites and coding!
I’m currently studying as a dual major in Computer Science, Information Technology and Web Science, with a minor in Graphic Design.
I’m looking to collaborate on Hackathons and any projects in general. I'm always excited to learn and speak with fellow coders.
